    <h2>grapefruit</h2>
    <p>The grapefruit (Citrus paradisi) is a subtropical citrus tree known for its relatively large, sour to semi-sweet, somewhat bitter fruit.[1] The interior flesh is segmented and varies in color from pale yellow to dark pink.</p>
    <h3>Grapefruit is a citrus</h3>
    <p>Grapefruit is a citrus hybrid originating in Barbados. It is an accidental cross between the sweet orange (C sinensis) and the pomelo or shaddock (C. maxima), both of which were introduced from Asia in the 17th century.[2] It has also been called the forbidden fruit.[1] In the past it was referred to as the pomelo,[3] but that term is now mostly used as the common name for Citrus maxima.[4]</p>
